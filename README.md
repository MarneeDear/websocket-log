# Why am I doing this?

I recently wrote a blog post using Suave websockets. It was a dead-simple example of a websocket server that just echoes back what the client sends to it. I made a new example that is just a tiny bit more useful.

See my previous article, [Plugging in Elm and Suave with websockets on .NET Core 2.0](https://steemit.com/technology/@marnee/plugging-in-elm-and-suave-with-websockets-on-net-core-2-0)
